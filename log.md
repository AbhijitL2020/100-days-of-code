# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Sep 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Set up Windows Terminal, WSL2, AND created an account and used GitHub!

**Thoughts:** Oh shit! I just read that it has to be CODE only, not the other things like tutorial and so on. That is going to complicate my quest. I want to learn Go Flutter and Dart. But I thought I will do it as I go. I want to build a toolset along with it. For example, if I were to plan the Error Message management system as a project, then I need to plan. Which is a good tool to plan? And I need to design. Which is the good tool to Design? All these questions, and answers to them is also a part of my 100DoC quest. I want to build an ecosystem around the project in which I will be improving my knowledge of modern day development paradigm. So...

### Day 1: Sep 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Installed GoLang, neovim, and plugins for auto-complete and delve, the debugger

**Thoughts**: I spent a considerable amount of time in getting the neovim installed and configured. It was my bullheadedness that I would not use VS Code. I first used vi in 1990 or 91. And I have come to love it. I remember the fun I had when my fingers remembered the commands, but not my brain!
So I wanted to do it with vi/vim. But then a reference pushed me to neovim. I thought it is an opportunity to improve myself. And I did. I touched some of the configuration files for the first time in the life.
I was always intrigued with the plugin based architecture, and could not let by the chance to do debugging through vi/neovim. So here we are.

I came across the book Learning Go through the reference 

I had fun writing my first program hello.go, and try out some tweaks based on the info there. 

However my struggles with git/github continue. This thing is hard to learn!
